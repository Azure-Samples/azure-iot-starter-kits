# Setup your device

Instructions below assume that you have completed the physical assembly of your Raspberry Pi 3.

## Network setting
You may use your preconfigured Grove Starter Kit Raspberry Pi 3 with WiFi only, Ethernet only, or both WiFi and Ethernet.

* Using Ethernet  

    **NOTE**: Please make sure your network address is not 192.168.4.x subnet.  The kit's Raspberry Pi 3 is preconfigured with 192.168.4.1 WiFi Access Point.  

    When boot is complete, you can see IP Address of your Raspberry Pi 3 on the screen.
    
    Example

        My IP address is [IP Address of Raspberry Pi 3] 
        [  OK  ] Started Session c1 of user root.  
        Starting User Manager for UID 0...  
        [  OK  ] Started /etc/rc.local Compatibility.  
        Starting Terminate Plymouth Boot Screen...  
        Starting Hold until boot process finishes up...  
          
        Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 raspberrypi tty1  
        raspberrypi login:  

    You can also find the IP address of the device, run `ifconfig` on the device and look for the IP address of the `wlan0` interface for WiFi and the `eth0` interface for Ethernet. (You should be able to SSH to the device using this address and the default Raspberry Pi 3 credentials.)

    Example
    IP address of the Ethernet is 192.168.1.10
    IP address of the Wi-Fi is 192.168.4.1

        pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ifconfig

* Using WiFi 

    You can specify your SSID and passphase later with the Azure IoT Starter Kit companion CLI

## Enable interfaces

1. Power on the Raspberry Pi 3 by connecting the USB/micro USB power cord to the Raspberry Pi 3 (via micro USB) and to a power source (via USB).

    **NOTE**: In some cases, after powering on your Raspberry Pi 3, you may encounter `undervoltage detected` warnings. If this happens, try using a wall socket (with micro USB connector) instead of your laptop as the power source. If that doesn't eliminate the warnings, try using a different USB cable.

1. Let the Raspberry Pi 3 boot. When boot is complete, you will see the console.

1. Launch raspi-config

    `sudo raspi-config`

1. Set your keyboard layout to the appropriate setting (Raspberry Pi 3 ships with UK layout)
    - Select option 4 for `Localisation Options`
    - Select I3 for `Change Keyboard Layout`
    - Select the appropriate values from the following screens, e.g. 'English (US)', pressing `ENTER` on each screen to make a selection

1. Select Wi-Fi country
    - Select option 2 for `Network Options`
    - Select N2 for `Wi-Fi`
    - If prompted for the country, select it from the list
    - Select `Cancel` where you are prompted for SSID


1. Press `ESC` to exit raspi-config.

1. Reboot:

    `sudo shutdown -r now`

1. Once the reboot is complete, check that the Wi-Fi network is visible.
    - Search for wireless networks using your laptop.
        - SSID : `SeeedGroveKit`
        - Passphrase : `SeeedGroveKit`


## Rebuilding Raspbian Settings
