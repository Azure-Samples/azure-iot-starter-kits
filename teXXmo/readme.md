## Concepts

At a conceptual level, enabling the teXXmo button involves the following steps:

1. Configuring the button
1. Provisioning and registering the device in an Azure IoT Hub. When you register a device, you will get a connection string for it.
1. Writing an Azure Function to receive messages from the button when clicked
1. Binding the button to the Azure Function

## Configuring the teXXmo button

You will use the Azure IoT Starter Kit companion App or CLI to configure your device as an Azure IoT device.  The App or CLI will connect your device to a wireless network, provision Azure resources for you, and bind the button to an Azure Function.
